** Installing Freqtrade on a Redhat Linux
- Install TA-lib using the installation script in =install_ta-lib.sh=

- Create and source the virtual environment, after which run
  1. =python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip=
  2. =pip install Cython= (Solves ImportError)
  3. =python3 -m install -e .=
- Multidict version conflict when running the bot
  - Run =pip install multidict==4.5.0=
* TODO
